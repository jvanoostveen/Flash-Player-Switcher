Flash Player Switcher
=============

*(Mac only)*

Background
--------------

Tired of running those Flash Player installers to see upcoming features in beta releases, testing in debugger versions and wanting full speed in release builds, an easier way of managing the Flash Player plug-ins files was needed.

Usage
-------

Use this tool to download plugin archives or copy the system installed Flash Player plugin to the plugin storage. Uninstall current system installed plugin and install other versions to add those to the storage as well with the same procedure.

Select a plugin from the list and click 'install' to place the plugin in the user library plugin directory (`~/Library/Internet Plugins`).

Roadmap
-----------

 * Design changes.
 * If a way is found to extract the files from Adobes own lzma implementation, add an even easier method of adding Flash Player plug-ins to the list.
 * Windows version?
